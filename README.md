# CrowdStrike GitHub Organization

This repository provides default community health files, policies, and reusable workflows for the [@CrowdStrike](https://github.com/crowdstrike/) GitHub organization.

These standards help ensure consistency and clarity across all repositories managed by CrowdStrike.

## Branding: Logo Usage

To maintain a unified brand presence, all repositories in the CrowdStrike organization should include the official CrowdStrike logo at the top of their README.md files.

The logos are hosted in the [assets/](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/.github/tree/main/assets) directory of this repository and are configured to support GitHubâ€™s light and dark themes.

### How to Embed

Add the following Markdown snippet at the top of your README.md file **before** any headings or content:

```markdown
![CrowdStrike Logo (Light)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrowdStrike/.github/main/assets/cs-logo-light-mode.png#gh-light-mode-only)
![CrowdStrike Logo (Dark)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrowdStrike/.github/main/assets/cs-logo-red-dark-mode.png#gh-dark-mode-only)
```
